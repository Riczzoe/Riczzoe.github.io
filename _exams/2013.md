In the 2006 film version of The Devil Wears Prada, Miranda Priestly, played by
Meryl Streep, scolds her unattractive assistant for imagining that high fashion doesn’t
affect her. Priestly explains how the deep blue color of the assistant’s sweater descended
over the years from fashion shows to department stores and to the bargain bin in which
the poor girl doubtless found her garment.

This top-down conception of the fashion business couldn’t be more out of date or
at odds with the feverish world described in Overdressed, Elizabeth Cline’s three-year
indictment of “fast fashion.” In the last decade or so, advances in technology have
allowed mass-market labels such as Zara, H&M, and Uniqlo to react to trends more
quickly and anticipate demand more precisely. Quicker turnarounds mean less wasted
inventory, more frequent releases, and more profit. These labels encourage style-
conscious consumers to see clothes as disposable — meant to last only a wash or two,
although they don’t advertise that — and to renew their wardrobe every few weeks. By
offering on-trend items at dirt-cheap prices, Cline argues, these brands have hijacked
fashion cycles, shaking an industry long accustomed to a seasonal pace.

The victims of this revolution, of course, are not limited to designers. For H&M to
offer a $5.95 knit miniskirt in all its 2,300-plus stores around the world, it must rely on
low-wage overseas labor, order in volumes that strain natural resources, and use massive
amounts of harmful chemicals.

Overdressed is the fashion world’s answer to consumer-activist bestsellers like
Michael Pollan’s The Omnivore’s Dilemma. “Mass-produced clothing, like fast food,
fills a hunger and need, yet is non-durable and wasteful,” Cline argues. Americans, she
finds, buy roughly 20 billion garments a year — about 64 items per person — and no
matter how much they give away, this excess leads to waste.

Towards the end of Overdressed, Cline introduced her ideal, a Brooklyn woman
named Sarah Kate Beaumont, who since 2008 has made all of her own clothes — and
beautifully. But as Cline is the first to note, it took Beaumont decades to perfect her
craft; her example can’t be knocked off.

Though several fast-fashion companies have made efforts to curb their impact on
labor and the environment — including H&M, with its green Conscious Collection line
— Cline believes lasting change can only be effected by the customer. She exhibits the
idealism common to many advocates of sustainability, be it in food or in energy. 
Vanity is a constant; people will only start shopping more sustainably when they can’t
afford not to.

An old saying has it that half of all advertising budgets are wasted — the trouble is,
no one knows which half. In the internet age, at least in theory, this fraction can be much
reduced. By watching what people search for, click on and say online, companies can
aim “behavioural” ads at those most likely to buy.

In the past couple of weeks a quarrel has illustrated the value to advertisers of such
fine-grained information: Should advertisers assume that people are happy to be tracked
and sent behavioural ads? Or should they have explicit permission?

In December 2010 America’s Federal Trade Commission (FTC) proposed adding a
“do not track” (DNT) option to internet browsers, so that users could tell advertisers that
they did not want to be followed. Microsoft’s Internet Explorer and Apple’s Safari both
offer DNT; Google’s Chrome is due to do so this year. In February the FTC and Digital
Advertising Alliance (DAA) agreed that the industry would get cracking on responding
to DNT requests.

On May 31st Microsoft set off the row. It said that Internet Explorer 10, the version
due to appear with Windows 8, would have DNT as a default.

Advertisers are horrified. Human nature being what it is, most people stick with
default settings. Few switch DNT on now, but if tracking is off it will stay off. Bob
Liodice, the chief executive of the Association of National Advertisers, says consumers
will be worse off if the industry cannot collect information about their preferences.
People will not get fewer ads, he says. “They’ll get less meaningful, less targeted ads.”

It is not yet clear how advertisers will respond. Getting a DNT signal does not
oblige anyone to stop tracking, although some companies have promised to do so.
Unable to tell whether someone really objects to behavioural ads or whether they are
sticking with Microsoft’s default, some may ignore a DNT signal and press on anyway.

Also unclear is why Microsoft has gone it alone. After all, it has an ad business too,
which it says will comply with DNT requests, though it is still working out how. If it is
trying to upset Google, which relies almost wholly on advertising, it has chosen an
indirect method: there is no guarantee that DNT by default will become the norm. DNT
does not seem an obviously huge selling point for Windows 8 — though the firm has
compared some of its other products favourably with Google’s on that count before.
Brendon Lynch, Microsoft’s chief privacy officer, blogged: “We believe consumers
should have more control.” Could it really be that simple?

26. It is suggested in Paragraph 1 that “behavioural” ads help advertisers to ____  
    A. ease competition among themselves.  
    B. lower their operational costs.  
    C. avoid complaints from consumers.  
    D. provide better online services.  
27. “the industry” (Para. 3) refers to ____  
    A. online advertisers.  
    B. e-commerce conductors.  
    C. digital information analysts.  
    D. internet browser developers.  
28. Bob Liodice holds that setting DNT as a default ____  
    A. may cut the number of junk ads.  
    B. fails to affect the ad industry.  
    C. will not benefit consumers.  
    D. goes against human nature.  
29. Which of the following is true according to Paragraph 6?  
    A. DNT may not serve its intended purpose.  
    B. Advertisers are willing to implement DNT.  
    C. DNT is losing its popularity among consumers.  
    D. Advertisers are obliged to offer behavioural ads.  
30. The author’s attitude towards what Brendon Lynch said in his blog is one of ____  
    A. indulgence.  
    B. understanding.  
    C. appreciation.  
    D. skepticism.

Up until a few decades ago, our visions of the future were largely — though by no
means uniformly — glowingly positive. Science and technology would cure all the ills of
humanity, leading to lives of fulfilment and opportunity for all.

Now utopia has grown unfashionable, as we have gained a deeper appreciation of
the range of threats facing us, from asteroid strike to epidemic flu and to climate change.
You might even be tempted to assume that humanity has little future to look forward to.

But such gloominess is misplaced. The fossil record shows that many species have
endured for millions of years — so why shouldn’t we? Take a broader look at our
species’ place in the universe, and it becomes clear that we have an excellent chance of
surviving for tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of years. Look up Homo sapiens in the
“Red List” of threatened species of the International Union for the Conservation of
Nature (IUCN) and you will read: “Listed as Least Concern as the species is very widely
distributed, adaptable, currently increasing, and there are no major threats resulting in an
overall population decline.”

So what does our deep future hold? A growing number of researchers and
organisations are now thinking seriously about that question. For example, the Long
Now Foundation has as its flagship project a mechanical clock that is designed to still
be marking time thousands of years hence.

Perhaps willfully, it may be easier to think about such lengthy timescales than about
the more immediate future. The potential evolution of today’s technology, and its social
consequences, is dazzlingly complicated, and it’s perhaps best left to science fiction
writers and futurologists to explore the many possibilities we can envisage. That’s one
reason why we have launched Arc, a new publication dedicated to the near future.

But take a longer view and there is a surprising amount that we can say with
considerable assurance. As so often, the past holds the key to the future: we have now
identified enough of the long-term patterns shaping the history of the planet, and our
species, to make evidence-based forecasts about the situations in which our descendants
will find themselves.

This long perspective makes the pessimistic view of our prospects seem more
likely to be a passing fad. To be sure, the future is not all rosy. But we are now
knowledgeable enough to reduce many of the risks that threatened the existence of earlier
humans, and to improve the lot of those to come.

31. Our vision of the future used to be inspired by ____  
A. our desire for lives of fulfillment.  
B. our faith in science and technology.  
C. our awareness of potential risks.  
D. our belief in equal opportunity.  
32. The IUCN’s “Red List” suggests that human beings are ____  
A. a sustained species.  
B. a threat to the environment.  
C. the world’s dominant power.  
D. a misplaced race.  
33. Which of the following is true according to Paragraph 5?  
A. Arc helps limit the scope of futurological studies.  
B. Technology offers solutions to social problems.  
C. The interest in science fiction is on the rise.  
D. Our immediate future is hard to conceive.  
34. To ensure the future of mankind, it is crucial to ____  
A. explore our planet’s abundant resources.  
B. adopt an optimistic view of the world.  
C. draw on our experience from the past.  
D. curb our ambition to reshape history.  
35. Which of the following would be the best title for the text?  
A. Uncertainty About Our Future.  
B. Evolution of the Human Species.  
C. The Ever-bright Prospects of Mankind.  
D. Science, Technology and Humanity.

On a five to three vote, the Supreme Court knocked out much of Arizona’s
immigration law Monday — a modest policy victory for the Obama Administration. But
on the more important matter of the Constitution, the decision was an 8-0 defeat for the
Administration’s effort to upset the balance of power between the federal government
and the states.

In Arizona v. United States, the majority overturned three of the four contested
provisions of Arizona’s controversial plan to have state and local police enforce federal
immigration law. The Constitutional principles that Washington alone has the power to
“establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization” and that federal laws precede state laws are
noncontroversial. Arizona had attempted to fashion state policies that ran parallel to the
existing federal ones.

Justice Anthony Kennedy, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and the Court’s
liberals, ruled that the state flew too close to the federal sun. On the overturned
provisions the majority held that Congress had deliberately “occupied the field,” and
Arizona had thus intruded on the federal’s privileged powers.

However, the Justices said that Arizona police would be allowed to verify the legal
status of people who come in contact with law enforcement. That’s because Congress
has always envisioned joint federal-state immigration enforcement and explicitly
encourages state officers to share information and cooperate with federal colleagues.

Two of the three objecting Justices — Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas —
agreed with this Constitutional logic but disagreed about which Arizona rules conflicted
with the federal statute. The only major objection came from Justice Antonin Scalia, who
offered an even more robust defense of state privileges going back to the Alien and
Sedition Acts.

The 8-0 objection to President Obama turns on what Justice Samuel Alito describes
in his objection as “a shocking assertion of federal executive power.” The White House
argued that Arizona’s laws conflicted with its enforcement priorities, even if state laws
complied with federal statutes to the letter. In effect, the White House claimed that it
could invalidate any otherwise legitimate state law that it disagrees with.

Some powers do belong exclusively to the federal government, and control of
citizenship and the borders is among them. But if Congress wanted to prevent states from
using their own resources to check immigration status, it could. It never did so. The
Administration was in essence asserting that because it didn’t want to carry out
Congress’s immigration wishes, no state should be allowed to do so either. Every Justice
rightly rejected this remarkable claim.

36. Three provisions of Arizona’s plan were overturned because they ____  
A. deprived the federal police of Constitutional powers  
B. disturbed the power balance between different states  
C. overstepped the authority of federal immigration law  
D. contradicted both the federal and state policies  
37. On which of the following did the Justices agree, according to Paragraph 4?  
A. Federal officers’ duty to withhold immigrants’ information.  
B. States’ independence from federal immigration law.  
C. States’ legitimate role in immigration enforcement.  
D. Congress’s intervention in immigration enforcement.  
38. It can be inferred from Paragraph 5 that the Alien and Sedition Acts ____  
A. violated the Constitution  
B. undermined the states’ interests  
C. supported the federal statute  
D. stood in favor of the states  
39. The White House claims that its power of enforcement ____  
A. outweighs that held by the states  
B. is dependent on the states’ support  
C. is established by federal statutes  
D. rarely goes against state laws  
40. What can be learned from the last paragraph?  
A. Immigration issues are usually decided by Congress.  
B. Justices intended to check the power of the Administration.  
C. Justices wanted to strengthen its coordination with Congress.  
D. The Administration is dominant over immigration issues.
